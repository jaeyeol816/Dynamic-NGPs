# miv-dynamic-NGP

## 1. Introduction

This software is implemented based on [instant-NGP](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp) and [camorph](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-IIS/camorph).

Reconstruct dynamic 3D scene by Neural Network Model.<br>
By training  [instant-NGP](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp)model per frame using "Transfer Learning", We provide relatively-high-speed and time-consistent video.<br>
For camera parameter and pose trace format, we adopted MPEG-Immersive-Video(MPEG) standard.<br>
Input: Set of yuv texture files, (MIV-format) camera parameter file, and (optionally) (MIV-format) pose trace file.<br>
Output: Rendered video of novel views containing dynamic scene.<br>
